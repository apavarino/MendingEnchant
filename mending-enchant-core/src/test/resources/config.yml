# DefaultProbability : Probability to have mending in percentage between 0% and 100% at enchant level 30.
# 0% = No chance to have Mending, 100% = Mending on all enchant
# Other enchant levels adapt to this value (if rate is set to 10% you have 5% chance to have it at level 15)
#
# You can also set up 3 customs probabilities : CustomProbability1 will be applied to player with permission mendingenchant.custom1
# Same logic for CustomProbability2 and CustomProbability3
# More information on project page : https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/mendingenchant

# YOU NEED TO RELOAD/RESTART AFTER ANY CHANGE
